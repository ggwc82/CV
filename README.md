'A white belt wearing junior software developer whose love for technology was rekindled as a Ronin student at Makers Academy'. I subscribe to the Software Craftsmanship manifesto, as well as all things related to Agile and Extreme programming. I was fortunate to be selected to video blog my coding journey which you can view at [Ronin by Makers Academy - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc4BYny7PXeQLLdl_meucEyKl8K9sI0SV).
